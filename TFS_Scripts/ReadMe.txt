These scripts are used for the execution (scheduling) to check-in the latest changes from the client.

This will allow for a procedural attempt at tracking and keeping updated changes made (currently done without notification.)

It will also put into place a structure that will let the central dev machine (FFIISTEST2) 'get latest' which will be from production.



The production processes will NEVER "get latest" overrighting any code!
