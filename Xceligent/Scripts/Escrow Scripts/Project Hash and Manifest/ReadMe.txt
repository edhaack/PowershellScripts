The Projects directory contains all of the source, per zip, for each project.

The "escrow.bat" will create the required "manifest" and "checksum" files. 
Before running this batch script, be sure that the latest successful build 
from TFS is placed in the "Projects" directory. It should look like the following:

- Projects\CDX.zip
- Projects\CDXDirect.zip
- Projects\ExternalLibraries.zip
- Projects\ReportGenerationService.zip
- Projects\ReportPortalService.zip
- Projects\ServicePortalWeb.zip
- Projects\xceligentApp.zip
